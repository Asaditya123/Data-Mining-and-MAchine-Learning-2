Image Super Resolution by Using Generative Adversarial Network 
Image data consumes a major portion of mobile network data usually for entertainment purposes and in other fields of application. The images might be of low quality due to bad weather conditions and other factors. Pictures captured by digital camera may come out to be of bad quality. Low image quality decreases the production value of created content
especially when seen on high-definition displays. There is a need for increasing the quality of these images which get degraded due to compression or original low resolution. Image enhancement is done using an adversarial network i.e, Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SR-GAN). GAN has several benefits as compared to other techniques such as feature guidance and unpaired high resolution model training. Generative and discriminative learning are used for training the model. The technique can produce perpetually satisfying enhancement in the sense of photo-realism. For the best result an upscaling of factor 4x is done. The hyperparameters are also optimized to obtain better results from the model. Final image is close to the original High resolution. The model was evaluated using loss function and peak signal-to-noise ratio. The project is implemented on Keras deep learning API on TensorFlow using python.
